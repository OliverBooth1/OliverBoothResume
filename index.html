          Hello to anybody who comes across my page! My name is Oliver Booth. I am a current second year at the University of California, Riverside, where I am studying history, though soon to be computer science with business applicaitons. I hail from Los Angeles, CA, where I was born and raised; my family now spends time between there and Palm Desert, CA. As a child, I grew up being obsessed with creating things. It first started with being obsessed with LEGO; I'd buy kits of different genres such as Star Wars or Police, and when it'd eventually break apart, I'd use the parts to create something different. As I got older this knack turned into a love for aviation, and being obsessed with creating scale replicas of different planes at home. This hobby was one of the first times I was given a cross-section of how things worked, whether that be engine components or efficient flight crew layout. In high school, I was lucky enough to join my school's robotics team, where we went to world championships twice. Here, I could take those applications of creativity to a more real, proffesional level. During this time, I discovered the practice of 3D Printing and it's applications, and immediately became affixed to it. It was astonishing realizing how could literally create anything in such a convenient and simply way. My love for creation isn't exclusive to the STEM field either, I output my creativity through other outlets, like music. For the past few years, I have be learning how modern-day producers create a new sound through the use of older ones, called sampling, and learning to know the basics of song structure and sampling other tracks to make my own via Garageband. It also has seeped through into how I dress: I love exploring different colors, proportions, and styles to make something entirely new or to fit a historical or cultural aesthetic.
          
          Now, as I am choosing what career path to take, I saw the potential of computer science and how many applicable creative solutions it held, so it was decided that should be my future career path. It astonishes me how many things I can do with a degree in a computer science-related field: Game Developer, Data Analyzer, and Sound Engineer are all possible jobs I can attain with that type of degree. My goal is to help posivitely change the world in a way that isn't being so right now. This could be applied in many ways: I can help fight climatae change, maintain workers' rights, or help the starving and poor. My output is strong, but my resolve is stronger. I believe I can make things happen. <br><br>
